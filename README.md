### What is Leaflet?

[Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) is a open source JavaScript library that is used to build web mapping applications. Compared to other libaries, Leaflet is much more lightweight and the code base is much newer, allowing us to use modern features of JavaScript, HTML5 and CSS3. We are using Leaflet because we believe it is simple, yet very powerful and accessible.
